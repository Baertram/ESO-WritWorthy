ESOUI forums poster Rhyono suggests:

What about analyzing the item link instead?

Here's an alchemy writ:

|H1:item:119818:6:1:0:0:0:199:26:4:6:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:50000|h|h

For the colored ones from left to right:
1. There are 12 alchemy writ IDs. This is what determines the base potion required.
2. Material type, for alchemy I'll assume it's always 199.
3. First property
4. Second property
5. Third property

Provisioning has 1 type, Enchanting has 2, Blacksmithing has 4, Woodworking has 4, Clothier has 4.
