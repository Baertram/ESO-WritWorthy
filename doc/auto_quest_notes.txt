I think that's all I need to "open" a master writ to start its quest.

If I need to actually accept a quest, here's how Dolgubon does it in QuestHandler.lua:


    -- Handles the dialogue where we actually accept the quest
    local function HandleEventQuestOffered(eventCode)
        -- Stop listening for quest offering
        EVENT_MANAGER:UnregisterForEvent(WritCreater.name, EVENT_QUEST_OFFERED)
        -- Accept the writ quest
        wasQuestAccepted = true
        AcceptOfferedQuest()
    end




Do this for 1-6 master writs, one of each type CRAFTING_TYPE_XXX
    +++ Add crafting_type to each parser. Watch out for clothing, we have TWO schools landing in that one station.

Then upon interaction with Rolis, auto-sequence through the dialog. See Dolgubon's QuestHandler.lua, HandleChatterBegin() and friends.

    EVENT_MANAGER:RegisterForEvent(WritCreater.name, EVENT_CHATTER_BEGIN, HandleChatterBegin)
