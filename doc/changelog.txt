[*] AwesomeGuildStore filter! You can now search guild stores for master writs that cost X gold or less to purchase + craft. Look for a "Per Voucher:" field when on the Consumables/Master Writ shopping tab.
[*] Preliminary Jewelry Crafting support. Disabled in this release.
[/LIST]

[B]4.0.3 2018-04-21[/B]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed: motif names appear in "Detail 3" column again. Thank you, tomtomhotep for the bug report.
[*] "Mat total: ?g" tooltip text now appears in red to better warn you that the per-voucher pricce ignores crafting cost. Thank you XomRhoK for the feature request.
[*] Add "+ bank" to window subtitle when showing writs from both the character inventory and bank.
[/LIST]

[B]4.0.2 2018-04-20[/B]
[LIST]
[*] Fixed: M.M. Fallback works again.
[*] New option: showing price in tooltip is now optional. Because some people use WritWorthy more for the crafting and less for the pricing. Thank you @Jerkling for the feature request.
[*] New option: Include bank when listing writs available to craft. Be careful with this: no warning if you craft the same banked writ on multiple characters. Thank you @UESP for the feature request.

[/LIST]

[B]3.3.2 2018-02-22[/B]
[LIST]
[*] Add HotR motif style IDs. Thank you, Rhyono for the numbers from CraftStore
[*] Remove unwanted LibAddonMenu.txt manifest file from like 2 years ago that was 1. in the wrong directory, and 2. shouldn't have been there at all. Thank you, Marazota for the find and fix.
[*] LibAddonMenu updated from r18 (!) to r25.
[/LIST]

[B]3.3.1 2018-01-29[/B]

[*] /writworthy command toggles window
[*] Exit crafting station after auto-crafting all we can at this station.
[*] Update to LibLazyCrafting 1.1.9 8ef2e2, matching Dolgubon's Lazy Set Crafter 1.1.6 and Writ Crafter 36.19.
[/LIST]

[B]3.2.5 2017-12-16[/B]
[LIST]
[*] by Dolgubon: Adapt to API in LibLazyCrafting 1.9.

[B]3.2.2 2017-11-09[/B]
[LIST]
[*] Update to LibLazyCrafting 1.5. Same library version as in Dolgubon's Lazy Writ Crafter v36.8 and Dolgubon's Lazy Set Crafter v1.0.19
[*] Allow WritWorthy window to be moved partially offscreen. Zig finds it [i]very[/i] handy to slide the window off to the right and just focus on crafting station names when doing dozens of master writs at a time.
[*] Stop making an unnecessary extra crafted provisioning/alchemy item. Thank you Dolgubon for finding a 100% reproduction case.
[/LIST]

[B]3.2.1 2017-10-29[/B]
[LIST]
[*] Update to LibLazyCrafting 1.4. This fixes the error "WritWorthy_Window.lua:1118: attempt to index a nil value"
[/LIST]

[B]3.1.5 2017-10-16[/B]
[LIST]
[*]"Show material list in chat" has a new "Alchemy only" option for folks (like me!) who only check the material list for alchemy.
[*]Bug Fix: check required materials right before attempting to craft alchemy or provisioning items. If you don't have enough Bugloss or Frost Mirriam, write that to chat and skip that item.
[*]LibLazyCrafting: update to version 1.3 (circa October 2017)
[/LIST]

[B]3.1.4 2017-08-26[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Refresh button
[*]"prosperous" -> "invigorating"
[*]LibLazyCrafting: update from version 0.4 to 1.2, adapt to some API changes
[*]LibLazyCrafting: fix bugs/missing features in 1.2, bump version to 1.3. This is not an official Dolgubon library release, so I expect bugs/surprises next time Dolgubon updates any of their crafting add-ons.
[/LIST]

[B]3.1.3 2017-08-15[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Manavortex's fix for autocraft window's error: "attempt to perform arithmetic on a nil value" if you run without Master Merchant.
[/LIST]

[B]3.1.2 2017-08-14[/B]
[LIST]
[*]"Motif X not known" fixed. I was off by +1 for all motifs.
[*]HotR Motifs added: Redoran, Hlaalu, Telvanni. Not sure if they'll show up in writs, but if they do, WritWorthy will now check Master Merchant for their style material prices, just likt it does for all other motifs.
[/LIST]

[B]3.1.1 2017-08-14[/B]
[LIST]
[*]ESO 3.1 Horns of the Reach/API 20
[*]Squelch errors for "table index is nil" for new item style constants.
[*]Autocraft: no longer add mystery +1 to motif index. No longer required or correct.
[*]KNOWN BUG: "Motif Barbaric not known" even though you do know this motif. For some reason the ESO API returns "false" for IsSmithingStyleKnown(barbaric=17+1) even if you know that motif. All motifs off by one.
[/LIST]

[B]3.0.7 2017-07-16[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Public API Support: new function WritWorthy.ToMatCost(itemLink) returns material cost for a single writ.
[*]Bugfix: Make WritWorthy global be the actual add-on, not the LibAddOnMenu pane. Thank you sirinsidiator and silvereyes for the report+fix!
[/LIST]

[B]3.0.6 2017-07-10[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Bugfix: would inconsistently fail to report "Motif XXX not known" for some motifs. Thank you Rhyono for helping me debug this.
[/LIST]

[B]3.0.5 2017-06-22[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Replace hardcoded skill indices with a runtime scan for localized skill name. Turns out those indices change from player to player, are not constants. And there are no "skillId" analogs to "itemId" constants. Oh well. Fall back to string matching. Hopefully this will end the many reports of nil errors on other people's ESO clients. I included the names for EN, DE, and FR.  I do not have a JP client, so I lack those names, sorry.
[/LIST]

[B]3.0.4 2017-06-20[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Bugfix: operator < is not supported for nil < nil.  Thanks to Tonyleila for the report.
[/LIST]

[B]3.0.3 2017-06-18[/B]
[LIST]
[*]New window with list of all master writs in backpack.
[*]Automatic crafting of writs.
[*]integrate Dolgubon's LibLazyCrafting 0.4, which is actually Dolgubon's LibLazyCrafting 0.3 but with Zig-added support for alchemy and provisioning. If those don't work, it's Zig's fault not Dolgubons. Thank you Dolgubon for all the help!
[/LIST]

[B]3.0.2 2017-05-28[/B]
[LIST]
[*] Morrowind API: replace temporary workaround numbers with actual constants for new styles. Thank you @Rhyono for the CraftStore Morrowind update which had all the quest IDs I needed for the "which pages do you know?" query.
[*] BugFix: never had a quest ID for the "Order of the Hour" motif. Now I do.
[/LIST]

[B]3.0.1 2017-05-21[/B]
[LIST]
[*] ESO 3.0 Morrowind/API 19
[*] Temporary workaround: some item style constants changed in the new API and until I can figure out the new ones, use magic numbers. WritWorthy might report incorrect known/unknown results for these three motifs: Skinchanger, Grim Harlequin, Hollowjack.
[*] Provisioning: require 2x crafting attempts, since most Provisioning writs seem to require 8 servings. (I assume any character performing master writs will have Chef/Brewer/Chemistry passive skills maxxed out.)
[/LIST]

[B]2.7.10 2017-04-04[/B]
[LIST]
[*] Option to fall back to hardcoded prices for common style and trait materials.
[/LIST]

[B]2.7.9 2017-03-22[/B]
[LIST]
[*]AHA Found the "Trait not known" bug for medium armor: when a writ required a trait for some medium armor piece (such as belt), WritWorthy erroneously checked the [I]light[/i] armor piece (such as sash).
[/LIST]

[B]2.7.8 2017-03-22[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Debug log: records details about the 20 most recent writs. If there's a problem with a writ, send a screenshot of the offending writ (or the UI error), and a screenshot of the writ that caused the problem. This ought to help me figure out what's going wrong.
[/LIST]

[B]2.7.7 2017-02-25[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Stop crashing auf Deutsch. When building recipe ingredient lists out of ZOS-returned data, use item links, not names, as element keys. All WritWorthy text is still in US English. The only change here is that it can run correctly when the ESO client is set to German.
[/LIST]

[B]2.7.6 2017-02-25[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Survive without Master Merchant. If missing, or if its database lacks some required materials, display "?g" for "unknown amount of gold" and don't count materials costs when calculating per-voucher cost.
[/LIST]

[B]2.7.5 2017-02-24[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Add big red text to tooltip if current character cannot craft the required item due to missing motif, traits or recipe.
[/LIST]

[B]2.7.4 2017-02-20[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Add a table of recipes to Provisioning so that the provisioning writs can show a material list even if the current character does not know the required recipe.  Fixes "Recipe not found" errors for such writs.
[/LIST]

[B]2.7.3 2017-02-16[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Settings UI: checkbox to enable/disable material list dump to chat. Too much clutter in the chat window.
[*]Bugfix: Alchemy materials had poison/potion = Alkahest/Lorkhan's Tears swapped.
[/LIST]

[B]2.7.2 2017-02-14[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Replace string matching with item_link parsing
[/LIST]

[B]2.7.1 2017-02-12[/B]

[*]First release. Uses string matching that worked only for US English clients.
