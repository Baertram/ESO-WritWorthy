[*]Debug log: records details about the 20 most recent writs. If there's a problem with a writ, send a screenshot of the offending writ (or the UI error), and a screenshot of the writ that caused the problem. This ought to help me figure out what's going wrong.

[*]Stop crashing auf Deutsch. When building recipe ingredient lists out of ZOS-returned data, use item links, not names, as element keys. All WritWorthy text is still in US English. The only change here is that it can run correctly when the ESO client is set to German.
