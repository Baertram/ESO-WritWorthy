Is this Master Writ worth doing?

Most writs consume less than 1000g worth of materials for each writ voucher they return.  But some consume 4000g+ per voucher and are probably not worth doing.

This add-on shows adds a line of text to each Master Writ's tooltip, showing the total material cost, and the cost per writ voucher reward.

It also dumps a complete material list to chat.

Requires [URL="http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info928-MasterMerchant.html"]Master Merchant[/URL] for material prices.

Warning: this add-on ONLY works for English. The add-on does a lot of string-matching against writ descriptions, and I only have the English strings.
