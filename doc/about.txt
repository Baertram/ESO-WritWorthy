Is this Master Writ worth doing?

Most writs consume less than 1000g worth of materials for each writ voucher they return.  But some consume 4000g+ materials per voucher and are probably not worth doing.

Shopping guild stores for Master Writs? Which is cheaper, 700,000g for a 72-voucher writ, or 400,000g for a 45-voucher writ? Sure, you could do division in your head or with a calculator. Or let the computer tell you (it's the 400,000g/45-voucher writ, just barely).

This add-on shows adds text to each Master Writ's tooltip, showing the total material cost, purchase price (if any), and the cost per writ voucher reward.

It also dumps a complete material list to chat.

Warning: this add-on ONLY works for English. The add-on does a lot of string-matching against writ descriptions, and I only have the English strings.
