Is this Master Writ worth doing?

Most writs consume less than 1000g worth of materials for each writ voucher they return.  But some consume 4000g+ materials per voucher and are probably not worth doing.

Shopping guild stores for Master Writs? Which is cheaper, 700,000g for a 72-voucher writ, or 400,000g for a 45-voucher writ? Sure, you could do division in your head or with a calculator. Or let the computer tell you (it's the 400,000g/45-voucher writ, just barely).

This add-on adds text to each Master Writ's tooltip, showing the total material cost, purchase price (if any), and the cost per writ voucher reward.


Not interested in writs that require something that you cannot craft?

This add-on shows big red warnings when writ requires a motif, trait, or recipe that the current character does not yet know.

It also optionally dumps a complete material list to chat. Surprisingly useful when filling Alchemy writs.

WritWorthy now writes a small debugging log to [I]SavedVariables\WritWorthy.lua[/I]. This should help me identify what it is about the master writ that triggers a bug in WritWorthy. Please send (or upload to imgur or gist.github.com or whatever):
