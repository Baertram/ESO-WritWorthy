Want to know which guild members donated gold to the guild this week?
Using that information to drive a weekly guild raffle?

This add-on scans guild bank history, then saves all gold deposits to a SavedVariables file. It can then convert that SavedVariables file to a CSV comma-separated-value file suitable for import into a spreadsheet.

Version 2.2.1.0 is a first version that just barely works on my machine. Publishing now to start gathering feedback and requirements from a few other folks.

[LIST=1]
[*]Click "Save Data Now" button. Add-on will fetch Guild Bank history from ESO's server and note all gold deposits.
[*]Log out (or relog). ESO will then save data, writing SavedVariables/GuildGoldDeposits.lua.
[*]From a terminal window, run
[FONT="Courier New"]% cd ~/Documents/Elder Scrolls Online/live/AddOns/GuildGoldDeposits
% lua GuildGoldDeposits_to_csv.lua
[/FONT]This creates SavedVariables/GuildGoldDeposits.csv
[*]Import GuildGoldDeposits.csv into a spreadsheet.
[/LIST]

[FONT="Courier New"]GuildGoldDeposits_to_csv.lua[/FONT] requires that you have downloaded and installed a standalone Lua interpreter, presumably from [URL="http://www.lua.org/"]lua.org[/URL].
