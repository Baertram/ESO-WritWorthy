Want to know how all your inventory is worth?

This add on scans all your inventories:
[list]
[*]characters
[*]bank
[*]craft bag
[/list]

It then adds up the value of all your items and gold and reports a total.

If you have [URL="http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info928-MasterMerchant.html"]Master Merchant[/URL] installed, it uses Master Merchant averages instead of the game's own NPC vendor price, when M.M. has a price.

[LIST=1]
[*]Log into a character.
[*]Click "Save Data Now" button. Add-on will scan bag, bank, and craft bag contents.
[*]Log into another character
[*]Click "Save Data Now".
[*]Repeat for each character.
[/LIST]

Yeah, this sequence is annoying and manual. I [i]could[/i] make it all automatic, but then I would have to tap into all your inventory actions such as look/sell/drop/craft/trade/send and that becomes a lot of extra event listeners. All those listeners, especially on loot events, makes for a slower game. No thank you. I would rather have a faster game.
